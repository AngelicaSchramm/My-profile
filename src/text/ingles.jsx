            reasonText: "While watching a series that showed engineers creating incredible things, even though I knew it was fiction, I became deeply interested in the subject. That's why I decided to do further research on technology and discovered algorithms in an online course on YouTube. Since then, I have been exploring the world of programming out of personal curiosity and also because I realize the many job opportunities that this field offers. Currently, my focus is on learning technologies like React and Next.js.",
